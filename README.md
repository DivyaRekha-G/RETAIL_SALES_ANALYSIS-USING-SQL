# RETAIL_SALES_ANALYSIS-USING-SQL
Basic Sales Analysis using SQL

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a retail sales dataset to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The dataset consists of transaction details, including information about each sale, such as the customer, product category, quantity sold, sale price, and the cost of goods sold (COGS). The analysis will focus on understanding key metrics such as total sales, average sale value, product performance, customer demographics, and sales trends over time.

# Project Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:

transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction.
sale_date: Date of the sale (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
sale_time: Time of the sale (in HH:MM:SS format).
customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
gender: Gender of the customer (e.g., 'Male', 'Female').
age: Age of the customer.
category: Product category (e.g., 'Clothing', 'Electronics').
quantity: Quantity of products purchased in the transaction.
price_per_unit: Price of a single unit of the product.
cogs: Cost of goods sold for the products in the transaction.
total_sale: Total sale amount for the transaction (calculated as quantity * price_per_unit).

# Objectives of the Analysis
1.Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
2.calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
3.to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
4.To calculate key metrics like average sale value, total sales, and profit.
5.To segment customers based on age groups and gender.
6.To calculate the profit margin by subtracting COGS from total sales.

# Business Recommendations Based on Retail Sales Analysis

1. Optimize Product Categories and Inventory Management
   
   --> categories like Clothing or Electronics show consistent sales, consider increasing inventory, launching targeted promotions, or expanding the product range in these areas.
   --> Discontinue or adjust marketing strategies for underperforming categories that show low total sales and quantity.

2.Targeted Marketing Campaigns Based on Customer Demographics

  --> strong sales trend in the 18-34 age group, so launch promotions, advertisements, or exclusive offers targeting this group.

3. Optimize Sales by Time of Day

   --> sales spike during evenings, consider scheduling more staff during those times and offer time-limited promotions to drive traffic.
